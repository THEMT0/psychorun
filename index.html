<h2>Your game title</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Race against yourself to reach the star at the end of the level.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
A sense of tension due to the dark imagery and disturbing tune that melds together from each repeat trial, combined with a competitive urge to beat their previous timestamp.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Run and jump platformer with speedrun elements.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player must run and jump across platforms to reach the star in order to clock their time, restarting the game, over and over again. The music will continue to play from each past attempt, making the game more and more tense each time. Use the arrow keys to move around, and the space bar to jump.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
To test the merits of a platforming game centered around the idea of speedrunning to achieve better and better times.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The speedrunning element of the game is relatively unique amongst platformers in that the goal is simple but the experience is tense and the repition adds to the tension with the help of the cascading music.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game is relatively abstract in nature, in that the setting, music, and color scheme are all plain to dark in the tone they convey, with the player character being the only exception. The character was originally envisioned as a firefighter, and all of the reds found throughout the game serve as an abstraction of a burning world.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You are a firefighter suffering the most bizarre and haunting PTSD-induced dream of your career.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The speedrunning community.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Seconds per iteration, a few minutes or perhaps even longer until the player either gets bored or is disturbed enough by the music to stop.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The easiest form of navigation is to fall and run, so I expect the best times to be found when the star is at lower levels.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
